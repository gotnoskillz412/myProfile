# MyProfile

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.3.2.  This project communicates with the [Option22](https://github.com/gotnoskillz412/option22) project, which acts as its backend API.  The name of this app is misleading because its purpose has changed multiple times before finally coming to fruition.  It is now meant as a goals tracking application, although you are free to fork the repository and turn it in to whatever you wish.  It consists of a registration and login page, a profile management page, home page, and list/form pages for tracking goals.  

You can view the project [here!](https://warm-cliffs-78940.herokuapp.com/home)  To see the app, create a profile and the rest will open up to you.  Your password is salted and hashed using security found in the [Option22](https://github.com/gotnoskillz412/option22) API. 

## Setup
`npm install`

That's it!

## Development server
Run `ng serve --port 4200` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). 

As of now, there are no end to end tests.  The testing has been done primarily with unit tests and manual testing.
